        What is Exploratory data analysis
    
        ```
        Exploratory data analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their
        main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA is the critical process of 
        performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, to spot anomalies,
        to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics 
        and graphical representations.
        A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the 
        data can tell us beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.
        
        It is a good practice to understand the data first and try to gather as many 
        insights from it. EDA is all about making sense of data in hand, before getting
        them dirty with it, which will be done below."
